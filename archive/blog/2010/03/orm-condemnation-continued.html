<p>Did I tell you that I am not a fan of OR Mapping solutions at all?<br>Why?<br>Because of concept and code bloat and very little benefit (if any). I am teaching developers this way:</p>
<p>Majority of business applications are comprised of 3 major parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Master Data</strong> - such as dictionaries and support tables</li>
<li><strong>Normal Processing/OLTP</strong>  - used every day, this is what app is used for, usually real-world data is keyed on [1] and stored depending on some sort of a date/time key</li>
<li><strong>Reports</strong> - query transactional-accumulated (or live) data (entered in [2]) , join it with master data for descriptions and output to user</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact of life is that &quot;Master Data&quot; tables (hundreds of them in big systems) are very dummy in the most cases, and any credible architect would build interfaces/CRUD logic in a template-based way. For those templates (base classes probably) SQLs are usually very simple, the row count is mostly &lt;1000 per table (not always), and really there is NO BUSINESS logic needed to be applied but map SQL columns to on-screen controls (be it Forms, Web or anything else). Making developer maintain a bloat of 100s of classes just to map A to A does not make much sense. What does make sense - build your general ancestor class smart enough to supply tons of metadata from your back-end automatically (such as max-length, required (not null), format etc...). I don&#39;t really need to map DB to object for that.</p>
<p>Now about [b] item - OLTP screens or entry processes(be it GUI or ETL or...who knows). Those definitely need to go through good interface in terms of classes, but again, if you have ever built &quot;big&quot; software that contains 100s of data-entry screens - the pattern becomes trending - you are NOT dealing with simple SQLs - now when user hits  &quot;Save&quot; you probably touch 3-10 tables etc. I personally never user ORM for that but write classes by hand with plenty of XML comments and human methods that are centered around business , not around schema. Database schema is designed for normal-forms compliance (most of the times), not class/interface usability by developers. So, in a financial system, I would have &quot;Portfolio&quot; class and &quot;Save&quot; method, and maybe even &quot;IStorage&quot; provider that implements direct SQL backing store so portfolios could save ,or maybe middle-tier store. So SQL is not the sole solution now.<br>The hand-written code makes sense though, and there is no bloat. Using LINQ to SQL would not have helped really as &quot;Save&quot; method for portfolios touches 10s of tables due to business rules. And I don&#39;t really want to have database code in C#, maybe database orchestration code I do, I&#39;d rather use stored proc, or maybe some other middle tier process as an abstraction layer. So now I need to use ORM there, again, I need to write good well-though queries that don&#39;t put unneeded locks etc...<br>So what benefit does LINQ to SQL/Hibernate/EF or any other tool would give in my case?<br><strong>None.</strong></p>
